<!--
    This project is a reverse engineering adaptation of the visual and interactive elements of the old YouTube page from 2009, 
    as archived on archive.org. The CSS and JavaScript files used in this project have been taken directly from the archived 
    version of the site to preserve the original look and feel. However, the HTML structure has been completely rewritten to 
    practice and understand the development process, while replicating the visual design of the original page.

    The primary purpose of this project is to study and learn from the design and functionality of a historically significant 
    web interface, and to recreate a similar user experience for my personal indie-web. This project is not intended to 
    replicate or replace any of the original functionality of YouTube, nor to be used in any way that could result in 
    financial gain or infringement on YouTube's intellectual property.

    I do not claim ownership of any of the original design, CSS, or JavaScript code from YouTube. This project does not aim 
    to generate any revenue and is provided solely as an educational tool and personal project.
